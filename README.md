Simple Components for Ada. The current version provides implementations of smart pointers, directed graphs, sets, maps, B-trees, stacks, tables, string editing, unbounded arrays, expression analyzers, lock-free data structures, synchronization primitives (events, race condition free pulse events, arrays of events, reentrant mutexes, deadlock-free arrays of mutexes), arbitrary precision arithmetic, pseudo-random non-repeating numbers, symmetric encoding and decoding, IEEE 754 representations support, streams, persistent storage, multiple connections server/client designing tools and protocols implementations. It grew out of needs and does not pretend to be universal. Tables management and strings editing are described in separate documents see Tables and Strings edit. The library is kept conform to the Ada 95, Ada 2005, Ada 2012 language standards.
